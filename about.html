				        </header>
					    <p>Welcome to Irish Dancing!  Inishfree Austin is a wonderful place for your child to learn life long lessons, excel at a unique talent, and create lifelong friendships.</p>
					    <ul class="style1">
					      <li><strong>Q: What age should my child be to start dancing?</strong>:<br>
				            A: Irish dance requires the ability to know your left from right, and count from 1-8. That being said, from our experience, we find that 4 years old is the youngest age to begin dancing. If you have a 3 year old, that you believe could handle the counting, and step memorization, feel free to bring them for a trial class. We will be able to determine if it is a good fit, or if they will need to wait a year.<br>
			              <strong>Your are never too old to start Irish dance.</strong> We have specific adult classes that are perfect for the more mature beginner.</li>
					      <li><strong>Q: What should my child wear to class?</strong><br>
					        A: We ask that everyone comes to class in athletic clothes, basically something you would wear to soccer practice. A T-shirt and athletic shorts work great. We do have students who wear ballet outfits, but this is by no means mandatory.</li>
					      <li><strong>Q: What shoes should my child wear to their first class?</strong><br>
		                  A: It is not mandatory that children have dance shoes to begin Irish dancing. For the first month or two, it is fine to wear tennis shoes or socks in class. If your child has ballet slippers from a previous class, they are fine to wear as well.</li>
					      <li><strong>Q: What is a feis?</strong><br>
                          A: The word feis means &quot;festival&quot; in Irish, and strictly speaking is also composed of competitions in music and crafts. Féile (&quot;faila&quot;) is a more correct term for the dance competition, but the terms may be used interchangeably. Many annual competitions are truly becoming full-fledged feiseanna, by adding competitions in music, art, baking, etc.</li></ul></section>

							<p>We are happy to welcome you to the Inishfree School of Irish Dance! This is a wonderful place for your child to learn life long lessons, excel at a unique talent, and create lifelong friendships. This page is designed to help you have a better idea of what Irish dancing is, and what to expect your first couple of classes.</p>
							<h3>About Irish Dance</h3>
							<p>Irish dancing is a bit different from ballet, tap, and jazz, in the sense that it is predominately competition based. We do have shows and recitals that we host and perform in; however, we do focus on competitions. Competitions are called a “Feis.” (Fesh) Competitions are held throughout the state, country, and world. At our school we send dancers to compete at the National and World Championship level every year.</p>
							<p>All of our beginners are taught 4 beginner level dances that they are able to compete with. Each dance is done to different music, and has specific and distinct steps. For the beginning months of class, our focus is building a solid technique base, so that your child can perform these dances to the best of their ability.</p>
							<p>We know that leaping into the world of Irish dance opens the door for questions you may have about being a new dancer. We have compiled a list of questions and answers that we routinely get from our newest parents.</p>
							<h3>About Inishfree</h3>
							<p>The Inishfree School of Irish Dancing has been one of the most prominent Irish Dance studios in the state of Texas for over 15 years. In this time children and adults have gained more than just the ability to dance.

							<p>We pride ourselves on giving Texan children a place to flourish within the competitive world of Irish Dance where we regularly represent Texas and the USA at major competitions worldwide. As well as this, we perform throughout the state giving even our youngest children the chance to show off their skills.</p>
